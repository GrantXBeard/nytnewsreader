## Overview

This app is designed to give users a quick glance at the the New York Times current top stories using the NYT top stories API. Users can sort through headlines based on sections and click through to see story details, photographs, and link to the article on the NYT website.

Made to emulate a take home technical challenge, the goal was to develope an MVP in a limited time frame while showcasing an understanding of usability practices and standards as well as React JS and Front-End best practices.
